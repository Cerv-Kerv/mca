Provide evidence of your sea service

<p class="govuk">
You must submit two different types of evidence that support your declared service. These evidence-types will usually be your Discharge Book entries and sea service testimonials.
</p>
<p class="govuk">
If your application requires confirmation of watchkeeping, at least one type of your provided evidence must support this.
</p>
<p class="govuk">
If you do not have a Discharge Book, you can provide Certificates of Discharge instead. Alternative forms of evidence of service can also include a company letter.
</p>
<p class="govuk">
If you have been working on Yachts, you may provide a Service Record Book from an approved organisation. If you are providing this you do not need to also submit a second type of evidence of your service.
