Provide evidence of your sea service</h1>

<p class="govuk">You must submit two different forms of evidence supporting your declared service. This is usually Discharge Book entries and sea service testimonials.</p>
<p class="govuk">If your application requires confirmation of watchkeeping, at least one form of evidence must support this.</p>
<p class="govuk">If you do not have a Discharge Book, Certificates of Discharge can be provided instead. Alternative forms of evidence of service can also include a company letter.</p>
<p class="govuk">If you have been working on Yachts, you may provide a Service Record Book from an approved organisation. If you are providing this you do not need to also submit a second form of evidence of your service.</p>
