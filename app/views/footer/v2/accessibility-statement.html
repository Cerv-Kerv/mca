<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h2>
 <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option). </p>
<p class="govuk-body">Non-HTML documents published before September 2018 do not need to be accessible - unless users need them to use a service. </p>

<p class="govuk-body">It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.
