      <p>
The data controller for your personal information is the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). This notice sets out how your data will be used and your rights under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 
 </p>
       <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">

Why we need your data </h2>

The MCA collect data to ensure we have enough information for us to check your OOE eligibility for booking an OOE exam. 
</p> 
       <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
Our legal basis for processing your data  </h2>
 <p>
Processing your data enables the MCA to carry out its official duty relating to Online Oral Exams. We process your data to:  
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ensure an applicant is entitled to apply for an oral exam </li>
<li>enable an applicant to book an oral exam </li>
<li>contact the applicant (if required) for the purpose of processing an OOE booking. </li> 
</ul>

What we do with your data</h2>
 
The MCA will not share your data. 
 
 
How long we keep your data  
 
We will retain your personal data for as long as you have a valid Certificate of Competency (CoC). If your CoC has an expiry date, has not been revalidated, and you have not returned to sea within 25 years of the CoCs expiry, we will remove your personal data from our systems. 

Where your certificate does not have an expiry date, such as Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) certifications, we will dispose of your data in line with our retention schedules. 

The MCA records Online Oral Examinations (OOEs) and Part B: Online Oral Examinations, to enable a review in the event of a candidate’s appeal or an Examiner’s concern. To protect the integrity of the OOE system, candidates will not have access to, or be able to obtain, a copy of the recording. 

Where no appeal is received, the recording will be deleted after 90 days. If candidates wish to appeal, they should do so within FIVE WORKING DAYS. Any appeal made after five working days will not be considered. 

 
Where your data is processed and stored  
 
Your data is securely stored on the MCA’s secure infrastructure. 

 
Your rights  
 
Information on how the MCA looks after data, your rights, how to contact our data protection officer and how to complain about processing of your personal data can be found on our personal information charter via the following link: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency/about/personal-information-charter.
